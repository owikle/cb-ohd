0:00:05,Denise,What's your name? When and where were you born and where did you grow up? ,q-details,Ada 
,Alexander Milles (AM),"I'm, oh goodness that was a big question. I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in Waikele, which is near Pearl Ridge or Pearl City where Pearl Harbor happened. Uh, what were the other questions? ",,
,Denise,What's your name? When and where were you born and where did you grow up? ,q-details,
,AM,"Alex. Um, yeah Alex Milles. ",,
,Denise,And when and where were you born and where did you grow up? ,q-details,
,AM,"Yeah, so my name is Alex Milles. I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. I grew up there for most of my childhood and then when I moved to High School I moved to Idaho…Boise. ",,
,Denise,"Okay, okay. So, what was it like transitioning from Honolulu to Boise? ",q-up,
,AM,"Unexpected. Um, you know I went with the stereotype of course I thought I was just going to be moving straight into potato fields. So, that was just the first expectation I had. For me it was more literal the changes I kind of dealt with as far as the weather. You know, I just didn't adapt as a child to changing weathers or weather that could kind of be hot and cold at the same time. So that was more kind of the things I grew up with when I was going with, moving first to Idaho.",comingout,
0:01:17,Denise,Were you sad to leave your friends and stuff and have to go to a new high school? ,,
,AM,"I had moved consistently in my childhood. My mom's military and she went through a divorce. So I mean, no. I was ready to leave at that point. I just wasn’t necessarily wanting to go to Idaho for sure. And I mean that was I think a big thing for me, was the culture shock. Hawaii is just completely different comparatively to Idaho and the way we culturist...or the way our culture established and you know, we literally in Hawaii separate the races. So the kids will, it's all Hawaiian, it's all Chinese, it's all set groups. Um, versus in Idaho it's very classical school. What you see on T.V is what you get kind of um, to some degree. So that was a new experience for me. Um, I actually talked about this with my best friend recently, but understanding the culture was something I kind of had to learn to do and I didn't even realize at the time that's what I was doing. And I kind of fell in love with my culture in a way because it was something I, you see on T.V. It's kind of a, I want to say Americanized, but you know, needs to be popular. ",comingout; other,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,Yeah. ,,
0:02:21,Denise,"So, how old were you when you moved here? Fourteen, thirteen?",q-details,
,AM,"Oh god, fourteen. Yeah, I think it was thirteen or fourteen. ",,
,Denise,Okay. ,,
,AM,"Fourteen. I remember my birthday particularly, but I can’t remember the year, the age I was. ",,
,Denise,"So, were you out? ",q-out,
,AM,No. Oh god no. ,,
,Denise,"Okay, so you had to come out in Idaho? ",q-out,
,AM,"Yes, oh yeah. ",,
,Denise,Okay. ,,
,AM,Uh huh. ,,
,Denise,So tell me about coming out in Idaho. ,q-out,
,AM,"Well I was so focused in my own personal life I didn’t put coming out on the table. I mean in high school I just never considered it. It was just something um…so I actually just finished reading The Velvet Rage. I don’t know if you've read it, but it’s an amazing book about men, gay men coming out. it also deals with I think anyone that's homosexual in general. Um, I learned a lot about just the coming out process through that. Um, at that point I, I, I, so children when they're growing up, children are actually the most astute at identifying cultural non-normative because they grow up understanding the culture that they're around. Um, so children can be uh, very good at picking out when someone isn't matching the normative. And so gay children identify from a very young age that something's wrong with them and they need to like cover it up somehow. And you see that with preschoolers. it's very hetero-normative. Kids will like play dates or play mom and dad. Things like that. And so I was too ashamed. I didn't want to process it and I was too busy focusing on the other aspects of my personal life I think to get that point. But college I think kind of the table turned because I wasn't with my family unit at that point. So I felt more comfortable and I was kind of, uh...so I actually spent a year in community college and I was going to school, doing my thing, and then when I went to the University of Idaho I kind of went balls to the walls and I just came out. Some of my fraternity brothers asked me and I was like obviously gay and I just kind of went with it from there and then from college it kinda just, it uh, coming out is a continuous process for gay men or for gay people. I'm sure they talk about that. ",comingout; models,
,Denise,"Forever. I talk with friends and it's like why do you have to keep coming out. Like straight people don't do it, you know. ",q-out,
,AM,"Right, right. Exactly. You don’t come out as black. ",comingout ,
,Denise,"No, it's annoying. ",,
,AM,"Yeah. It’s annoying and it’s definitely something interesting and I've learned a lot from my professional work stuff. That's I think the harder component. Do you come out at work and do you feel comfortable talking about that issue. Um, you know I'm lucky I work in a nonprofit, so I feel comfortable to have that conversation, but at my new job, which is publishing I wouldn't necessarily really bring that up to people just because I don't think it's appropriate necessarily. ",comingout; work,
0:04:50,Denise,"No, it's not. Okay, so who did you come out to first? And how was, how was the experience and what was the response? ",q-out,
,AM,"You know I was drunk, I'll definitely say, so it was a lot easier for me. I mean it just came out like butter. Uh, it took me a year before I was able to say it sober. It took me, the time I did it, it took me three hours of crying and not being abe to say it because I couldn't say the words. And I was like pushing myself to, so it was kind of a process for me. When I first came out drunk I just, I mean it was, it was easy. It was simplicity. I mean they, I was already very flamboyantly gay at the time. So it was just a matter of me accepting if someone asked. And I remember specifically I was actually just with my Greek twin at the time, who I still have a relationship with. Her boyfriend, who they have now broken up, he had asked me, he was my fraternity brother at the time and I was like 'oh yeah' and then it just kind of roll balled from there. Yeah. ",comingout; q-out,
,Denise,"So, when did you come out to your family? ",q-out,
,AM,"I didn't come out to my family. My best friend actually, basically, I was going through a really hard fraternity experience and so it kind of got to a point where I was very emotionally distant from her because I was trying to figure out what I was going through. And that kind of happened for me. I'm not, I don't really do...it's funny because I'm an extrovert, but kind of when push comes to shove I need everyone out of the room and I need to make my own decision. I don't deal well with like a crown consist talking to me. And so that's kind of what happened. My closer friend group I kind of alienated for a while as I was going through this fraternity situation. Um and she basically wanted to kind of distance herself from me or she knew that I was distancing myself from her and it was a little melodramatic. She kind of took it a little too far. But she told my family about what was happening with the house and my mom kind of naturally assumed it was because of my sexuality even though the two were not together at all and I say that like consistently. Fraternity life is not always homophobic by any sense of the word. Um, but that's kind of, that's what happened and so I came home and basically it was kind of like already out on the table so I like missed the gun I guess. ",comingout,
,Denise,Was that a relief? ,,
,AM,"No, no. I felt like it was something taken from me. I think it was something I would've preferred to do on my own and make that process forward. Um, but I mean yeah, it was kind of nice at the same time for sure. I mean not having to deal with that pressure. Um, because I think in general just deal with that disappointment and it's just a very emotional moment, so I got to avoid it. ",comingout,
,Denise,Do you feel like it was disappointing to your family? ,,
,AM,"Um, well I mean I felt definitely nervous. My mom grew up Catholic and I was raised Catholic, so I just didn't want to break the religious normative of my family. Um, but I mean I didn't necessarily have any self shame, which I think a lot of gay men go through. I think it was more just like shame from a cultural perspective and just like societal perspective. But as far as internally once I realized I was gay in high school I pretty much just went a long with it. I just knew that was me. ",comingout; religon; family,
,Denise,"That's cool. That's cool. Okay, let me get through all of these and then I have so many other questions based on what like you were just talking about. ",,
,AM,I love it,,
,Denise,"Okay, so um tell me about the fear. Was there fear of coming out? ",q-out,
,AM,"Oh yeah, oh definitely. I mean in general you know, from adolescence you learn from very early on that homo…uh that being homo…that being gay is considered wrong, so yeah definitely. I definitely…uh one of the first core memories I actually talked about this is some of my writing exercises recently was I had been writing...or I was going through all like my childhood stuff and like writing about it. And one of the things I didn't realize um, was that I didn't know what 'fag' meant. I mean I was so protected as a child and so naive to a lot of swear words. Um and so I learned gay and homophobic swear words through the eyes of children. So they would call them to me and I learned how bad they were through people's like body...through the connotation of what it meant versus like the actual definition. ",comingout; homophobia; q-out,
,Denise,Interesting,,
,AM,I mean you could see disgust on someone's face. It’s pretty obvious. ,Homophobia,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,Uh and so I learned it that way. I think most gay children probably go through some level of that within their pubescence. ,comingout,
,Denise,That's terrible ,,
,AM,"Um, it's not the greatest for sure. And it's something right that it's just if um if people were racist towards black people or any race um, you, what do you do about something like that? And I think that's actually something I talk about a lot um and I try to promote is a lot of gay men and I was among that group when I was in high school, I didn't think I needed to come out. My idea was well why do I have to? I'm not dating anyone so what's the point? I don't want to disturb the boat anymore than I have to. Um, now that I have come out you know, I do realize it's importance because the thing is, if a person isn't able to identify their sexual orientation or just like own up to it um, it's, saying it, verbalizing it to others to me is like you finally accept the fact that there will be people that don't like you based on your sexual orientation and identity, so you just have to accept that and just move forward. Um before you say it publically you can't move forward until you do. ",comingout; homophobia; advice,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,Yeah. ,,
0:10:12,Denise,"Well we wanted to make like make people educated. So they're not, I mean, okay…",,
,AM,"It's…oh definitely. I mean I think education is a constantly going process, right. We're learning from all the stimuli that's happening in our lives and I think it's kind of a process and sometimes I, I mean there's an ideal way of doing it, but I don't necessarily think, necessarily think we're getting there and so it's a lot of hard conversations. I know for me when I was in fraternity life there were many brothers of mine that were super uneducated about being gay and what that looked like, the LGBTQ and I had to be the one that was the front person and um there was actually a previous gay member who um, created really bad ideas of what it is to be a gay man and so I had to establish for them that that's not normative and show them differences of what it means to be gay. ",comingout; clubs,
,Denise,Interesting,,
,AM,Mhmm. ,,
,Denise,So can you tell me about the fraternity experiences ,q-other,
,AM,Oh sure.,,
,Denise,That you were arguing about? ,,
,AM,Yeah. A bad experience? ,,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,"Um I joined a fraternity first. So the way recruitment kind of goes when I was in college was you show up on day one of recruitment and for the guys and then you just walk around and you have to find the place that you're going to sleep. So, there's no set place where you're going to sleep. You just literally have to find a house where you feel comfortable enough where you can like sleep over. Like most houses are like super open about that, but you can see that right? ",Comingout; other,
,Denise,Yeah. That's bizarre. ,,
,AM,"Yeah, right. The fear of acceptance and just…",other,
,Denise,I didn’t know that. ,,
,AM,"Yeah, yeah. It's changed. They changed it two years ago. Um, but yeah that used to be a…and it created a dynamic where recruitment would happen in a different way because of that fear. You know kids being scared that they wouldn't get into a house that they wanted or things like that. But with that process it was bad for recruitment because people would end up in houses they didn't necessarily want to be in. You know you're a freshman in college or I was a sophomore at the time, you don't necessarily know what you want or what the Greek experience looks like. You know, they're not going to tell you x, y and z of the house. They're only giving you the perfect picture image because it's recruitment, right. That's all they're focused on. So I joined a house and what I didn't realize what it just didn't match the integrity of what I wanted in a house. And so I just went through, when you finish recruitment it's kind of the idea that you don't join another house, you're done, you're going to join that house and go through initiation and most sororities within you know the next month will initiate their membership. In fraternities it's different. I initiated in that fraternity all the way in February actually. I was in your course. And it was actually when I finally realized, the first time I dropped your class, was um, we were in the video tech building and I went to the bathroom and I was supposed to go to chapter. I had just initiated and I was just shaking. I was just straight up shaking, which is like not, I mean I can be a little shaky at times, but not, not my MO. at all. But I was just crying because I was dreading the idea of like going to chapter, I was dreading the idea of being in the house, but it took me a long time before I was able to just identify the unhealthy relationships that were there. Uh but it kind of, what basically ended up happening was someone had poured water into my laptop, completely broken it. It was a Mac, yep, my mom had to buy me a new one, which uh. And then, yeah, won't even go in to say it about that. But I wasn't going to study table for two weeks, why would I go to study table in the bottom of our basement when there's no computers. That just doesn't make logistical sense. And all of my classes at that point had online, I had no like books or anything like physical to do. And with JAMM it's like most of our stuff is online or like paper oriented. It's not like, and I need a computer to like be able to do research. And so I got fined for those hours, basically they pulled my voting privileges from the house, they pulled my like social privileges from the house. I was told that if I didn't pay the fee within I think two days they pull the electricity from our room, so the membership that was within my room, which was like my Greek family, right they're all angry. Like we're gonna lose electricity because you're not paying your bill, so it was just a lot of that and I finally looked at the members that were seniors and I asked myself 'do you want to be these guys when you graduate?' and not one of them quite honestly say that I wanted to be when I was a senior and so I left. And I just didn't agree with a system that was freshman orientated and so some houses operate on the idea that you know, the freshman do a lot of the work, so that's like Homecoming and a lot of these events. They pour all this things in, but as you get older it gets better. Um I couldn't agree with that because it ruins the freshman a lot of the time. It's too harsh of an experience for them. Um even in houses that function well and I thought it should be an even effort. We should all be working together as a group and so I just couldn't fundamentally do that, so left. ",other; homphobia; comingout,
,Denise,"Was it malicious, them pouring water on your computer? ",,
,AM,I don't know. I don’t know who did it. I still to this day have no idea how that happened. ,,
,Denise,Do you think it was homophobic and reactionary? ,,
0:15:00,AM,"I don’t think it was homophobic. I mean my mom kept kind of jumping when I had fraternity issues that she felt was homophobic, but that house in particular has multiple, lots and lots of gay men, so I…",homophobia,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,Wouldn't consider it homophobic at all. It's more group culture. ,,
,Denise,"Group culture and the leadership, so the leadership maybe at the time. ",,
,AM,"Oh a Marriott of both. Yeah I mean I learned a lot about organization and group culture through fraternity life. Um, it's very easy for groups to become disorganized and toxic and negative and it's a constant process really. ",other,
,Denise,Yeah.,,
,AM,"And yeah, I think it was just the group. I, I've never been one, it’s funny because I hate when people call me popular and it happens sometimes, I'm like don't call me that. I think it’s because in general popular is you're well known and you're well liked and I don't think I'm necessarily always well liked, but I'm always well known. And so there's a difference at least in my eyes. Um, but with that I've never been one to push myself to be well liked either. I've always kind of been like hey you either like me or you don't. This is like me. But I just didn't um, so basically when I first joined the house I engaged so much with other communities, I mean okay I'm going to join the Single Relations Board, so we have like access to the Alumni relations and then like all these events happening and then maybe I'll build myself in leadership and look good as an external source for the house. And I was actually thinking when I think about it now when I engaged I was thinking  about engaging for the house. I mean it wasn't even for myself at that point. Uh but what I didn't realize was the house wanted you to be very internal and not do anything outside of the house and be very focused on just what you had on your plate, which has never been my forte at all. I'm always looking at everyone else's plate. Um, and so yeah. It didn't fit and I actually, I went, I got snapped by two other houses over the summer. So I thought I had been initiated. Usually when you initiate you can't join other houses. Like the lay of the land. Um and I actually found out through Joe Harper, one of my good friends who was on the judicial board, he was of the inner fraternity council of our school. Um that technically the if that governs the fraternities doesn't have a policy for you to not join another house if you were initiated. It's only the local, it's only each house that specifically states those policies. So if a house doesn't have a policy against you joining when you've initiated then you can totally do that. Um and so I got some bids from other houses. I was looking at AKL in particular, Max and a lot of other people, I'm sure you interacted with or Alex Han...",other,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,"lot, lot of them, but anyway my bid got turned down, so like, I was going through the process. I was interesed and then basically um, Phi Delt just, or my fraternity just trashed talked me. I mean obscene things. At that point I didn't know how bad it was. I just literally had the bid pulled and I knew, I knew that it was from Phi Delt. I didn't know how it had been orcistrated. Um, and I'm very good at knowing information, I mean that's why I'm a such a JAMM major, but it's like that's one of my skills. If I want to know something I will find it out. Um, but so I gave up. I was like 'I'm not gonna be greek.' And I went into the dorms or I went into an apartment living and I was like moving on and then I ended up having, I ended up having a kegger, um one of my friends fraternities um, and then from that point on every single day I was with them. Like I mean religioulsy doing things with them and that was the hard thing I think for me was that I liked the overall greek aspect of the experience. I just didn't like my fraternity experience in itself. Um and so I just, I found myself with them every single day and then finally, I can't remember. I do rememeber kinda the specifics. But one of my, the friend that I had the kegger for was like 'you know, it would've been so great if you were Phi Tel.' We were drunk talking at this point. It was like 2am. Um, I was like 'well I could be a Phi Tel, I mean if I wanted.' And then we, we, yeah. I ended up joining a house. And one of the...",other,
,Denise,What year were you when you did that?,,
,AM,I was a junior/ senior. ,,
,Denise,Interesting,,
,AM,"Yeah I was at the, yeah I snapped the spring of my junior year, which is like unheard of to be initiated into a different house, unheard of. And I remember one of the things my, so you get a greek big brother in the house and it kind of works itself in different houses. Um, but my first fraternity big brother literally told me when I was leaving the house that I would be a dropout. 'You're not going to graduate obviously if you leave the house. Like you're not going to be able to make it. Like you can't keep yourself together.' Um, and basically and not only that, I think it was kind of that I'm mister right, like you're not going to do anything. Um, and you know, it was very big icing on the cake for me to say you know, fuck you. I joined another house. I got another big brother and I graduated, so. And I actually, it was funny. I saw him my senior year and he wasn't able to find a job right out for electrical engineering, which I thought was crazy, but it was kind of like tooting my horn. Yeah. Just a little bit. And you know, I, a lot of those guys I don't have ill will with. I think like I said was a lot of that group culture that kind of infected them. ",,
0:20:00,Denise,"Okay, so back to…",,
,AM,Going back to LGBT. ,,
,Denise,Yes. Did you have a support system? Was your mom supportive after how long or? ,q-supportive,
,AM,Well my mom's in a same sex partnership. ,family,
,Denise,Oh my god. I love it. ,,
,AM,"Yeah, I found it out last fall. So, she was more accepting than I ever realized. Um, I don't know if she's necessarily lesbian or bi, I really haven’t like pushed that cart or pan. I mean I just kind of let her guide that conversation. Uh, but yeah she was super open to it when she did find out. Um and it was kind of a...we just kind of nicked it. I mean my mom was like 'so you know Kassi told me this, like are you gay?' Like yeah, I guess. I mean it just kind of came out that way. But she was super supportive. I don't, I feel like it's hard because it's not like um, an illness that cancer where I'm like oh I need your support for my gayness, right, you know it's just one aspect of myself. ",family; comingout,
,Denise,Right.,,
,AM,"But I've always had a good support community. But I think that's a lot to do with me and just like um, I think people should just focus on people that love you. ",clubs; advice,
,Denise,"Yeah. Would you, okay so I guess my question then is in Idaho in particular like Boise is a little different than other parts of Idaho and you had come here from a place that was very different culturally and maybe a little diverse. ",q-up,
,AM,"Yeah, I mean there's homophobia within Hawaii in its own spectrum",homophobia,
,Denise,"Oh for sure, yeah. ",,
,AM,"Um, but in Idaho in particular are you thinking that intersectionality? ",,
,Denise,"Yeah, I'm just wondering about like your experience and how maybe it's not typical for people coming out in Idaho. ",q-out,
,AM,Yeah. ,,
,Denise,Because they live in a more rural area or it's so fucking conservative. ,q-up,
,AM,Right. Well I mean I guess like what…,,
,Denise,I guess my question to you is how do you describe your experience as opposed to others people's experiences that you've heard about in Idaho? ,q-effect,
,AM,"Okay um, I think it's hard. I think every LGBT person deals with their experience like very differently and actually after reading Velvet Rage there are similarities that I think you do go through, but um it's kind of like railroad tracks. There's like four different tracks, so I mean comparatively um I think it kind of depends upon the track you ended up picking. Um so for instance, gay men in particular, I was talking about this earlier, the shame. They learn, they learn to not deal with their shame and so it comes out different ways. For me I think my process, I think I was lucky, I mean you know surprisingly, you know actually you'd be surprised to find in conservative more rural states you'll find more protection and more normativity and more hedgamond type of atmosphere than in bigger cities. And there's actually this documentary that was done, it was like a fake type of thing where they bring in actors and pretend to have like a homophobic dispute and then see what would happen. And a lot of the times in smaller cities and like random towns people would be more defensive of them, but in bigger cities like New York they just would not even address it. Like no one would talk. ",comingout; models; homophobia,
,Denise,Interesting,,
,AM,"Yeah. So I think you know you'd be surprised at the people in this community um and also just like, you were saying, we were talking about this earlier about education. I think it has a lot do to with education and I think we kind of you know, just like Trump supporters, we paint them all on one picture. Homophobia is painted in a rainbow. Just you know, it's very diverse and so a lot of people in this community are just not educated properly, you know have certain biases and schemas and so it's kinda about working that. I think for me, personally I've learned really well to kind of navigate that. To kind of operate in the conservative atmosphere. I worked for a summer with nuns who completely didn't know my sexuality I would say. They would talk about me getting a girlfriend, totally. ",homophobia; politics; religon,
,Denise,And what do you say? Nothing? ,,
,AM,"Oh, nothing. Why, why rock the boat if you ask me. You know, I think that's a major Idaho thing, you know why rock the boat. You know, I think…",,
,Denise,You shouldn’t have to. ,,
,AM,"Right, right. Exactly. You don’t come out as black. ",,
,Denise,That's fucked up. ,,
,AM,"Um I mean I don’t know, I, I think that sometimes with older people I think though it's just the way they were raised. It’s what they know ",,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,"And especially with the religious, it's so engrained within them because of how deeply they revere scripture, which is crazy to me because I think they need to look into their scripture a little bit more, but…",religon,
0:24:29,Denise,Well you were raised Catholic. At least it's interpretive. It's not literal. ,,
,AM,"Right, right. Exactly. You don’t come out as black. ",,
,Denise,"So, do you still practice? ",,
,AM,"I consider myself spiritual. So actually at my work I'm the only one person in my work that considers myself religious. But I wouldn't necessarily call, I identify as an omnist, so I think every religion has its own  truth. I love learning about other religions whether I practice one religion in particular, not really. Uh, you know I, if my family, like if I'm in Massachusetts we're all going to church on Christmas then I'll go or things like that. Um, I find solitude in a lot of religious practices and I think really what religions are, are just you trying to find joy and peace in god. And you know they're all a million different pathways, they're all a million different right ways, so I mean I use a lot of different things in every religion. And my Catholicism, I do go back to a lot despite its homophobia for sure. Um, I think that religions are beautiful and to just you know to just totally demonfy, to totally hate them based on the fact that they are homophobic, I think is sad because there are a lot of LGBT people that are turned off from religion. You know, who is, I was just making this post about the Mormon religion, they just recently released a policy two years ago, a year ago about um children not being able to baptize and go through the church if their parents are gay. They're ostracized  until they're eighteen and they choose to ostracized their parents. Um, which is completely traumatic and just ridiculous. ",religon; work; family; homophobia,
,Denise,That's horrible,,
,AM,"Well yeah I mean the Mormons also if you look at history they did the thing with black people, so who knows what will happen in the next twenty years. Um, but for sure my point though is um, who are you to tell someone they can't have a relationship with god if you really believe in god because in my perspective that's their own kulianai and not yours. ",religon,
,Denise,Very well put. Very well put. ,,
,AM,Thank you. ,,
,Denise,"Uh, do you, were you raised by a single mom? ",,
,AM,Mhmm. Yeah ,,
,Denise,Do you think that shaped your experience? ,q-other,
,AM,"You know there are some studies that people do think there is some type of relationship with your father that can shape your sexuality. Um, sure. I mean I do have firm memories when I was five, that's when my parents divorced and I went to counseling because my parents divorced and our counselor told my mom that I was gay and she moved, she switched counselors. And that was one of the firmer memories of why I didn't come out, was because from that young age. And I didn't even know right what gay was, but I knew something wasn't right and that carried with me. I was a very...knowledgeable child. Very, very soaked everything up like a sponge. Um, so yeah for sure. ",comingout; other,
,Denise,"Okay, okay. Um, what models or messages do you think you had as a kid about the LGBTQ community? And like can you recall making sense of any of those messages  like T.V, film whatever, like was that something that you reacted to? ",q-models,
,AM,"Oh, yeah. You're meaning more of a media message? ",,
,Denise,Yeah. ,,
,AM,"Oh Yeah, I mean media messages are what got me through I think. I mean, I, I to this day still get frustrated with the media coverage. I think, glad, maybe they're doing a great job, but I don't know. I think there's a lot of work to be done just because...for instance Shandra Rimes gets praised for her um, or including different diversities, but only a lesbian, there was a lesbian couple or you know on Grays Anatomy, one lesbian couple out of a cast of how many and the populous, right like I think, I understand that we are a small minority. I think film needs to, video needs to put more effort in making in conscious, so everybody can see it themselves. So, having a black character, having an Asian character, having a gay man, a lesbian woman in different forms and showing that. I think that's the thing I get frustrated with most is you know, we are put into a cast of what being gay looks like. ",models,
,Denise,"Yeah, it’s not like a character, actor being funny. ",,
,AM,"Right and a lot of stereotypes you know are true to some degree and everyone has their own, but I think it's also about breaking those molds and getting like to the humanity is really important and why we're that way and what does that look like. ",models,
,Denise,Yeah. Was there anyone you looked up to? ,q-models,
,AM,"Myself, I looked more readily for it than before. Before I was more ignorant of it or I felt guilty enjoying like that one scene of like a gay character, you know. I mean and I think that's the bigger thing I think of is like you know, in a T.V show they'll have that like two seconds of like 'He's gay!.' For gay people that two seconds is like our hour right, yeah and we're just like into it. I think when someone hasn't come out, there's that guilt and shame comes in and so you just literally, you love and it and also you're like ashamed by it and so you ignore it. ",models; advice; comingout,
,Denise,That's terrible. ,,
,AM,"It's interesting. It's an interesting dynamic. And you know having read the book it's, I think the bigger thing to me I think about in Idaho is just the sex education in goes back to and not even just…",models; politics,
0:29:41,Denise,And what sex education did you get? ,,
,AM,"Oh yeah, none. I mean I won't, I was a hoe in high school. I mean I slept with the average of three men a day. I mean, I, I was kind of promiscuous. Just a wee bit. But nothing. We're talked, I mean we had abstinence only education. We learned about how condoms were ineffective. We had one day about STD's where we really got the fundamentals about the diseases, really nothing as far as preventative care. Um, and as far as LGBT type issues, nothing, alright, I mean I think for me more so that was where part of the shame kicked in. You know, I know that something isn't confirmatively right because we're talking about the birds and the bees and I don't want any of the birds, just the bees. So, I think that was something for me that I always pick up on that just our sexual education, it is criminal. I mean you are not educating the public, not only gay or not only LGBT, but I think as a whole society we deal with a lot of issues based on that lack of education. ",politcs; homophobia,
