,Jerry Schutz,"My name is Jerry Schutz. I was born December 11, 1964 in Long beach, California. I grew up in Moscow, Idaho.",,
,Denise,When did you move to Moscow?,,
,Jerry Schutz,We moved to Moscow in 1968.,,
,Denise,"Okay, so you were four. ",,
,Jerry Schutz,I have to rephrase the question. I forget to do that.,,
,Denise,"No, you don’t have to. This is an oral history, so we’re good.",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Oh, okay.",,
,Denise,What was it like growing up in Idaho?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"I had a kind of Aussie and Harriet Beaver kind of family. You know two boys, I was the older, my brother was eleven months younger. Dad worked, mom stayed home, and you know, kept the house, did the dishes, cooked you know. So, yeah, it was kind of a normal upbringing. I mean granted we were the first ones on the bus and rode 40 miles a day to come back to go to school that was like a mile over there, but you know I got to see the country side and I got to meet, you know that was my community because where we are now, the city was half a mile out that way where our neighbor was a quarter mile away, so.",family,
,Denise,What did your dad do? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"Uh, dad worked for WSU. When he moved up here he was a heating and air conditioning. He had his own heating and air conditioning business in California. When heh moved here and he worked for Sears for a while then he worked for WSU. He started building the trailer park. He had a roller skating rink out at the mall. It was really small. It was the first roller skating rink in town and then the trailer court. Those are the ones I remember most. I think there’s something I missed in there that, another little business he had, I don’t remember.",family,
,Denise,What did you do as a kid?,q-up,
,Jerry Schutz,I went to school.,;q-up,
,Denise,Where did you go to school?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"I went to McDonald elementary, Moscow Junior High and Moscow Senior High. I went to the Presbyterian day school for kindergarten. I was in second grade in 1972 when Richard Nixon was elected president. I remember that. Mrs. Peterson was my first grade teacher. Miss. Aimes was my kindergarten teacher. Miss. Law was second grade teacher. Miss. Herden was my third-grade teacher. Joe Brown was my fourth grade teacher. I had both Karen Tallon and Nancy Peterson was my fifth-grade teachers and then Mr. Carlson and Davis were my sixth grade teachers and then when you got to Junior High they just all you know, you ended up having individual classes and I could probably go back through and name them all. It’s really not important.",,
,Denise,That’s crazy that you remember all of those. Tell me about the Boy Scouts.,,
,Jerry Schutz,"Yeah, so I started as a Cub Scout. My mom wanted, mom was the first female Cub Master probably in the United States. We were the Lewis-Clark district at the time and they, they knew about it, but they had her sign everything LW, so that the people back at Boy Scout Central didn’t know that LW didn’t stand for Lillian White and so she got to be our Cub Master and we, you know I went on to do webalows and Boy Scouts and was in two or three different troops. I was in the Saint Maries troop, the Moose lodge had a troop and then ended up at the Presbyterian church. And yeah, those were weakly meetings, usually on Monday and Tuesdays and you know, campouts and summer camp. You know, I got to do summer camp and the staff up at Grizzly did that for about five years. Yeah, um I was an Eagle Scout, one palm I think I got. I got, my eagle scout in 1982. My Chevy Go signed by Ronald Reagan and yeah that was an interesting chapter.",,
,Denise,"So, tell me currently then looking back, what happened with the Boy Scouts?",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Oh well, eventually, I was working at the, I was a volunteer adult leader and I was volunteering with the camp grizzly advisor committee and at the same time I also owned Link Transportation company and one of my employees wives found out I was gay and so she took it upon herself because she had to protect the Boy Scouts to tell them that I was gay. So, then they called me and said, ‘so we got this report and are you gay.’ I was like ‘well yeah.’ And they were like ‘well if you tell us no, you can continue to serve.’ Yeah, no that doesn’t work for me.’ So they sent me a cease and assist letter, I didn’t represent that qualities that they come to look for in the adult leader and I was becoming, actually I had just become the chamber president for the Moscow chamber of commerce. I was the youngest chamber president ever. And that also hit the paper at the same time. The being gay and the business community was like ‘what. That doesn’t affect anything.’ And it was really, it became a really kind of a movie and then so the Boy Scouts, the basically said you know, here you go, psht gone. One thing I did do was I coordinated when I was in the National Guard at the same time, coordinated getting Camp Grizzly lake, water front expanded as a training mission for the combat engineers, which are company B, one hundred and sixteenth I think we were. Combat Engineers, so we went up there and dug a new part of the lake out and then in the spring it filled back up and they got a bigger water front and a soccer field.",work; homophobia,
0:06:08,Denise,"So, did the Boy Scouts ever contact you after that?",,
,Jerry Schutz,No. ,,
,Denise,No? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"No, they just sent me the one letter that I was done and I’ve been, I’ve been in contact with the Boy Scouts throughout the time, but yeah, I just haven’t had any time or inclination to try and fight it, so recently with the decisions I was able to join the Boy Scout, or you know the Eagle Scout Association and yeah, I’m getting a little bit more active in it, but you know I’m probably never going to be full on adult leader quality anymore because, kids, I don’t want them.",,
,Denise,"Okay, so going back to growing up,",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Dirt clod fights. We use to have dirt clod fights with my brother and friends. You know, while we were building the trailer court, so you know, it wasn’t always grass and so as they were leveling things we had piles of dirt and we would go out with our Tonka trucks and build roads and dump water in them and make hydrologic projects. And always have these rivulets because you get these huge water gully washed like we’ve being having and it makes some rather large erosion on unlined earth, so we would get in trenches across from each other and lob, big old dirt clods at each other until somebody got hurt an you know, we got hurt, fun was over so then we’d have to go do something else.",,
,Denise,"Okay, when did you come out?",q-out,
,Jerry Schutz,"I came out when I was 25. I had kind of decided, actually I was I knew I, well okay let’s say I should’ve known when I was in seventh, eighth grade. I was taught that, that being gay was wrong, it wasn’t the norm, so I didn’t come out until I was 25. I had decided I needed to be able to be living on my own and not depending on my parents in case something did happen and you know, not disowned and whatever, so I was living in Seattle. So, I drove back here on a weekend, went up to the lake, hung out with mom and dad, told them I was gay at the end of the weekend, mom said, weird thing she said was ‘you can do better than that.’ I was like ‘better than what?’ and then as I drove back home into the sunset because I was driving back to Seattle, on the radio, Bruce Springsteen was singing ‘born in the USA’ and the sun was setting and it was like ‘okay. This was a pretty successful weekend.’",comingout;q-out,
,Denise,What did your dad say?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"Um, nothing. He really has never said anything about being gay. he just, guess takes it in stride. We never really have had a discussion. I respect the fact that he doesn’t want to talk about it and even when Will and I were together, and you know, Will disappeared, he still never discussed any of that with me. He did with Wills parents, but yeah, I was never part of the discussion, so.",comingout; family,
,Denise,"Okay, so take me through after you graduated from Moscow Senior High school, what did you do?",,
,Jerry Schutz,"I went to as far away from Moscow as I could and snow, so I got a Roxy scholarship was a, an army Roxy scholarship I believe and went to Arizona State University and majored in Nursing and while I was there I had two very good years of school and then my third year, I found sun tanning and beer and got a 0.23 and decided that nursing, well school in general wasn’t where I needed to be, so I packed up my life and came back to Moscow and started working as a nurses aid for a little bit and it was wonderful job. I loved it and most tiring job, most rewarding job I had ever had and then over a series of events, I ended up going into business and kind of, I worked at Pullman Hospital as the parking Nazi because Pullman Hospital used to be in campus right there by the science library and so any student that came by there and parked on hospital, in the hospital parking lot, I would call parking services and they would come and ticket the cars. The hospital paid me a fairly decent wage to sit in my car and read books for most of the hour, that you know, I would get out in the last twenty minutes and see when cars changed and yeah, I made about sixteen thousand dollars in parking fines for WSU the year I was working there.",,
0:11:16,Denise,"Right on. Okay, from there you went to Seattle?",,
,Jerry Schutz,"From there I went to Seattle and worked at Lamont’s in the corporate office. I was a traffic clerk and my basic function was mail sorting and delivery and tracking freight charges and I would audit the invoices and I came back with like between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars in back billed freight that shouldn’t have been billed to the company and that, that was the job I did and I did that for a while until I realized that somebody was going to have to die in order for you to move up in the company and my boss was, about twelve years older than me so I was going to have a long wait. So, I went to the international air academy in Vancouver, Washington and learned how to be a ground operation airline employee and so I got a job with United and was cross-trained on baggage handling, ticketing, plane servicing and marshaling and I, my favorite part was always marshaling because you got to go out there with magic fairy wands and direct the plane and then, and um ticketing was fun. I remember the worst customer I ever had was some lady who was trying to get to Spain and it was of course foggy, it was February as Moscow will be and so no plane was coming in and no planes were going out and she like ‘but I have to get to Spain, I’m going to miss my connections.’ And so, I ended up telling her ‘ma’am there are two people in this airport that care about getting you to Spain today, one of us is losing their patience, please go over there and sit down and I will call you as soon as I have some information for you.’ I got in trouble for that, but, you know, it was a shock for her and she went over and sat down and you know, and I got her to where she needed to go and she wasn’t terribly happy about being put in her place, but you know, what am I going to do, you know pick up the phone and say ‘hello god. Can you take the fog away, I gotta a plane I want to get going.’",work,
,Denise,"So, when did you go into the military?",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Um, okay so before I went to Seattle when I was working for, it had to have been when I was working for the, that was at the time I was working for the Best Western as the limousine driver and my boss’ husband was the recruiter and he came in on a December afternoon because he always came in and had coffee and he happened to catch me on a day where I was feeling like I was having a midlife crisis, I was probably 25 at the time. And he had me come down to the armory because they were having the 215th birthday party for the national guard and I come down, have some cake, blah, blah blah, little did I know I would be running home, getting my High School diploma, my transcripts, and signing for a four-year hitch and a six year hitch with the National Guard.",work,
,Denise,Where did you go? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"I went to Fort Linterwood, Missouri for basic training and then I went to Fort Lee, Virginia for my AIT. I was a 76 Charlie, which was a parts records. I was responsible for all of the parts that would keep the company operating for thirty days in the field, so I was responsible for having all of the hemmi, Humvee pats, the jeeps, the twos and a halves, we were combat engineers and I had full stock for, you know everything. I had mechanics, under you know, beside me, with me and I had the drivers, so I was in charge of issuing the equipment and driving policies and I was in charge of making sure the mechanics had the parts to do what they needed to do or ordering the parts that they needed to repair the, the missions, so.",work,
0:15:23,Denise,What years were you in there? Do you remember?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"I got out in 92’ when I bought link, so I had to be in somewhere around 86’ ish, I’m gonna say.",,
,Denise,"Okay, so no war? ",,
,Jerry Schutz,"No, no no. I was completely a peace-time soldier. I came in right after graneta and I got out right before the first desert storm, so I was a full peace-time volunteer soldier. My deployments were summer camp and we went to Grangeville and built a sewer system. We went to Alaska, Fort Richards and built bridges and did bridge deployment and went to Gowen Field once and went up north somewhere and camped out in the woods for two weeks.",work,
,Denise,"Tell me about ‘Don’t ask, Don’t tell.’",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Don’t ask, don’t tell. Well they asked, I lied. I was in before don’t ask, don’t tell, so I was in when they asked about it and you lied about it if you wanted to be in. And I was confronted about it while I was in AIT and I lied because you know, that’s I felt, you know that strongly about being able to serve, serve in the military so.",,
,Denise,"Tell me more about how you feel about 'Don’t ask, Don’t tell,' now.",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Well, I mean you know, don’t ask don’t tell or the integrated services is great, I mean there’s really no reason that men should be, or women should be kept out of the military. I mean combat positions, I you know, the Israelis have been doing it for years and everybody, men and women serve two years in the military. You know, I make the joke that if I was benevolent dictator for a day, it’s one of the changes I would make so that there would be some kind of public service after you get out of high school. Whether it be the department of agriculture, the department of land, forest service, military, core of engineers, something and those would be the projects we would be doing. You know, fixing the infrastructure, that’s what the core of engineers would be doing. Forest service, building trails, well agriculture, learning how to farm and those practices and then go back to your civilian life and you have a skill and you have a job and you have learned responsibility because one of the things we don’t, our parents aren’t teaching anymore is responsibility, it’s all ‘oh. You participated. Here’s a trophy.’ I know I’m going to get killed on that, but seriously, you lost. But yeah, we don’t teach, I am responsible for doing something, so you know, I felt responsible growing up as a Boy Scout. It’s one of the things that the Boy Scouts instill is that, you know do a good turned day, you know I did my best to do my duty, to god’s country, to obey the scout law and help other people at all times, to keep myself mentally strong and morally awake and so, I never interpreted morally straight as sexual, I interpreted it as morally on a straight compass, in the right direction, not going behind you or wherever the temptation was. And then you know, the scout law, I mean that’s the other part, the scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent and over the years, I really think about each one of those thoughts and those principals are what I try to live my life by. That’s how Boy Scouts actually affected me and why I think it’s a wonderful organization and I can add that gay boys are now able to be Boy Scouts and gay leaders are able to be leaders again. So, you know because it’s, the principals are really the principals we should be teaching our children, or not my children, somebody else’s children because I don’t want children.",work; politcs; homophobia,
,Denise,"Very good, so...",,
,Jerry Schutz,Did I answer the question that you asked?,,
,Denise,"You did. Yes. Going back to coming out, you waited until you were?",q-out,
,Jerry Schutz,Twenty-five.,;q-out,
,Denise,Twenty-five. To come out to everyone or just your family?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"Family. Actually, I come out a couple years earlier to my brother. I took my to a restaurant and was like ‘I got something to tell you.’ And he was like ‘what? You’re queer.’ And I was like ‘well I prefer gay, but yeah.’ And he was like ‘don’t tell dad.’ And I think mom also told me ‘don’t tell dad.’",comingout; family,
0:20:00,Denise,Did you tell friends before your brother?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"Yeah. I started testing the waters, you know soon, right after I moved out of Moscow basically.",,
,Denise,How old were you then? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"I don’t know. I didn’t really put a name to it. I graduated in 83’ and sometimes I can think of years, you know you could drink when you were nineteen and some of those brain cells in my early years probably got killed along the way. I had a boyfriend in high school before I graduated. So, you know that would have been 17 or 16. And then again, so there’s a ten year period where I was dealing and coming out and you know, you didn’t have a lot of role models and it was kinda funny you know, I had Kathy Sprague who I had known since second grade and she was a lesbian and so that was one of the things that you know, kind of hit me was she was out, she was running her own business, she was successful and you know, so it was like ‘yeah. I can be gay and successful.’ And you know, I just have to be cognoscente of pronouns and so I did the pronoun switch for years and years and years and when I went into corporate America, I think that was probably the first thing, it wasn’t Lamontes, it was probably United when it was the first-time sexual orientation was okay to be gay. It was okay to be gay at a major corporation and so it was like okay. So I didn’t have to pronoun switch anymore and you know, I’m not having sex at work, so does it really matter and just because I went to the movie with a friend last night, I mean I don’t care if it was a male or female, it was a friend who liked the movie and we had a good time, so you know, sex and the work place and again, the fact that I couldn’t get fired for who I was going to a movie with, that was kind of an important thing and this point, or that point in my life I was starting to realize, that you know the people that didn’t want to be around me because I was gay weren’t people that I wanted around me either, so you know I started developing a core of friends that were on the supportive side and I got to say I grew up republican and this is not my republican party currently and you know, if you’re watching this twenty years from now, I hope the republicans have taken what was once my dear grand old party and they’ve taken it back from the religious wrong, but you know it’s only been in the last eight years that you know, I’ve had to vote democrat because the republicans have gone so far out of whack and I just completely got off the subject.",comingout; politcs; religon,
,Denise,"Oh no, so you talked about Kathy being a role model?",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Yeah, as Kathy being a role model, yeah.",,
,Denise,But what other models or messages did you have about gay people when you were young?,q-models,
,Jerry Schutz,"Well. Most of them were, well you know, I always point back towards Shawn’s Trilogy and The Rows, two gay movies where they have tragic endings and so being gay was going to be tragic and there was going to be lots and lots of drama and everyone’s going to talk like Harvey Firesteen. But you know, If you think about those movies where you know, they were main stream at the time it was personal best, it was Philadelphia, it was right at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. You know, all of the sudden it was the gay disease. I remember, Kathy again, she and I went to one of the, so there was a number of organizations over the years, whether it be the Inland Northwest People’s Gay Alliance, the Gay People’s Alliance, the Inland, I mean INWGPA was the one that I was on but there was INGPA or I mean, there was just other gay organizations, but they were mostly based around the university and they were mostly grad students at that time, but we would, they would have dances once a month an Kathy and I went to our first dance together, kind of as moral support and it was one of the most horrifying experiences of my life. I showed up at the door to pick her up, I thought I was smartly dressed in khakis and a red, you know one of those red and white kind of striped shirts, the oxford style with a red sweater over it, so you know that it kind of popped and a camo colored trench coat and I knocked on the door and Kathy answered in the exact same outfit. And we both were both just like ‘oh shit.’ And so, we went to the dance together looking like we were a couple. It really confused not only us, but many of the other people there and we did at least get known as the twins for a while.",models;q-models,
0:25:16,Denise,"So, talking about those organizations that you just mentioned, how did you use them? What was your experience like?",q-effect,
,Jerry Schutz,"It was the dances, it was the only real group or support where you could meet somebody. You know, at one point The Garden was considered, it was listed as a gay place, but you had to be discreet. There was The Chameleon, which was where the Red Door was and now it’s going to turn into something else. I think a wine tasting place if you’re looking at this twenty years from now, but that space was The Chameleon, which was owned by the partner of Charlotte Buchanan, who had One More Time, which was a vintage, vintage clothing and collector cards and jewelry. It was a great shop, but they were partners, so she had this, The Chameleon.",clubs;q-effect,
,Denise,Was it a bar? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"It was a bar. Beer and wine and appetizer kind of foods, not like Red Door, you know, Food food, but yeah, same space. Not much difference to it.",,
,Denise,"So, when you were uh, a youth, who or what were supportive people, places or spaces?",q-supportive,
,Jerry Schutz,"Probably the Boy Scouts just because, I mean it was something I did every week and I was with, you know my patrol or my troop with anywhere from 15-25 people. Patrol was usually in the 8-12 range and so you know, those were my friends because you know living out here in the middle of the sticks, you know we were the first ones dropped off in the middle of the afternoon, but the first ones picked up in the morning. And so, the bus was also my kind of support group and then at school, like in grade school I was never really, I mean I would get annoyed at recess because it was, okay, I hate to say it, it was wasted time. so I would crawl up in a , we had these window sills, they were like the windows were recessed, so I would fine a nice sunny one and read a book. I would curl up and read a book for a while and going through junior high for the first couple of years that I had to take lunch, I would just to the library and read during lunch and then I petitioned the school board to, well I petitioned the junior high and they were like ‘no. We can’t do that.’ Then I petitioned the school board to get rid of my lunch. I wanted to take a class instead of eating and I would grab a granola bar between classes, but I wanted to take band and I wanted to take home ec. and I wanted to take Spanish, so we got to make this happen you know. I’m willing to give up lunch so eventually I was able to give up PE and add another one, so yeah, I was about, I was going to school to learn, which was what I was supposed to be doing, so playing on the playground at lunch, again was just kind of a waste of time.",clubs;q-supportive,
,Denise,"What were difficult or dangerous people, places or spaces?",q-danger,
,Jerry Schutz,"Holes in the ground that we dug in the hillside were dangerous places. I remember digging because I was telling you about how we, dad was just pushing the dirt off when he was making things, so we dug a hole into one of these and I know at one point with what we thought was you know, soft and fluffy right, Owen corny pink fiberglass insulation. So, we lined the whole little cave we dug with that and came out with the worst case of hives ever and then two days later the hole, the hole just kind of collapsed on itself. And we would never use nails when we built forts, we would use a little like, you know a house of cards, you just layer them and just kinda start laying stuff, well my brother and I would build these forts out of scrap lumber and just kinda stack it on top of each other, so the breeze would blow it down. So you know, these were our forts for many years and fun.",;q-danger,
0:29:37,Denise,"Haha. Oh my god. Um, current thinking interpretation. What are the most important resources and strategies that help you live your life today as a gay man? What about when you were younger or as a teen?",q-resources,
,Jerry Schutz,"Then I have to say probably my peer group. My support group, my people I surround myself with that support me that I support you know that is the resource, you know I have a good day, I have a bad day, those are the people that I’m sharing it with. That’s the essence of the question, I mean the things that I picked up along the way you know, the citizenship and the community nation world from Boy Scouts you know, knowing how to go out and build a lean to shelter so that I could, if I was in a plane crash, I could you know, first aid, those life skills, you know, knowing people’s names I’m great at and I just kind of think of it, I mean resources, I, there’s the internet now, but back then there wasn’t that many, I mean you could get the advocate and yeah, you could hear what Chasity Bono was doing or you know, but even so it was, it was, the gay culture of the time was really, I mean I have a problem with gay pride because gay pride is nothing but drag queens anymore and muscle men. You know, while I am very proud of being gay I really have no desire to march in a parade and rainbow stalking’s or an outfit or the friends of Dorothy or ride on a float from a gay bar. You know, that’s one of the things I’ll say about Moscow that growing up we never had a gay bar. I mean we kind of had The Chameleon once, but for the most part, gay social life in Moscow has always been dances, you know with the original, Inland Northwest Gay people or Inland Gay People’s Alliance, you know Northwest Gay People’s was dances. And we’ve had them in various places and now there’s the drag show and the drag shows have been going on for twenty years and Kathy and Tabitha to their credit have supported and built the drag show as the social event for gay and lesbian youth on the Palouse and it happens almost on a monthly basis, so well there’s not a gay bar at least there’s an event where you can meet people and that’s something that we didn’t really have you know, when I was a youth, when I was growing up, so I think we’ve come a long way and you know I think as we continue to go forward the resources are only going to be more and more. I mean, now you’ve got the internet, so you know, you can get on YouTube and say you know ‘I’m a nineteen-year-old kid and I’m having problems with this.’ Or they could type and then somebody will type back to you and you’ll have a discussion and you’ll grow and you’ll learn and that dialogue will take place, but yeah back then it was, you know, the four people that I knew and you know and then being in the university community, the population, if you think about the population age range, it kind of stays the same and I just keep getting older because they just keep rotating out every two or three years, so you know, you get them broke in as part of the community and off they go to Seattle of Portland, to wherever, and by that I have friends scattered all over the world. And you know, some of them I still, not most of them, some of them I still keep in contact. There are some that I don’t even remember, but you know, that has been one of the things about my life that has been, by living here and having the university and being involved in the community and meet people and then they move, more so than I think they would in a, another type of community and definitely in the outlier communities.",clubs;q-resources,
,Denise,"Thinking back on all of these experiences, how has being gay affected your life? Good, bad, whatever. What has it given to you or added to your life?",q-effect,
,Jerry Schutz,"Well, it’s added a thick skin, you know I had to come to grips early on that I really don’t give a crap what you think of me because I am who I am and I’m a good person and I’m sorry that you only see something that happens for five minutes every three or four weeks. You know, and you’re gonna, you’re gonna challenge my life off of that five minutes, but you know I shouldn’t be loved, I mean I shouldn’t be judged on who I love, to be judged on how I love, you know and the quality of my love is pretty much unconditional and you know, having become a nurse now, I really understand where I should’ve been the last thirty years of my life, but on the other hand I’m not gonna regret it at all because it made me who I am and you know, my path has brought me to here, so it’s been a pretty good life. Um, what does being gay, so I have a tough skin because of it. I had three very wonderful relationships, I still am waiting for mister right and hopefully twenty years from now when you’re looking at this, I will have found somebody and settle down or I’d be dead by now. Twenty years from now, yeah that’s seventy, yeah, I, you know figure I’m gonna be here at least till 85, modern medicine might be able to push me to 95, so I may still be around twenty years from now and you can come back and talk to me again. And, yeah.",comingout; advice;q-effect,
0:35:41,Denise,"Have other aspects of your identity affected your experience. Race, class, ethnicity, weight, age, religion, disability.",q-other,
,Jerry Schutz,"Yes, I’ll just stop and say yes, everything. Everything affects your life and who you are, you know the fact that I eat chocolate bars and dip it in the peanut butter makes, affects my life because some people think that’s absolutely horrible because that’s double dipping and I’m sorry. You know, I hate football, some people will judge me because I hate football, but you know what, I can think of better ways to spend three hours in afternoon than sitting in front of a TV screen, watching other people beat each other up. I might want to watch a movie or I might read a book or I might garden, but you know, and football happens in November, so I might go out and shovel snow. That would be more fun than watching a football game. You know, everything you do affects who you are. You know, I’m not a religious person, but if you were talking to somebody who was Catholic right now, you could ask them easily, what do you give up for lent. I give nothing up for Lent because I don’t celebrate Lent, you know, so everything that you mentioned affects my life and how does it affect it, it made me who I am, and I really don’t have a better answer than that. Everything you do, every decision you make affects you and makes you, hopefully all of the things you’ve done before allows you to make the best decision you can make at any given moment, again, that’s what affects your life.",advice; other;q-other,
,Denise,How do you think your experience is different being from a relatively rural place opposed to somebody that’s in an urban place.,q-rural,
,Jerry Schutz,"Well, I can definitely say that by being in a fairly rural place, especially during the, early part of the HIV epidemic, I was in a safe place. I mean while AIDS was happening, we didn’t have AIDS in the community, I mean we had people of developed HIV, we had very few actual full blown AIDS victims at that point. Those were happening in the metropolitan, bigger areas. Now we did have some influx because people would come from Seattle, Portland you know, and I talked about you know, Moscow is kind of that community that the university kind of keeps bringing people back, but had I been in a larger community or more urban setting, very likely I may not have been here and survived through that epidemic. I actually feel, I’m fifty two right now and there are, in the gay male population, I’m kind of a minority because a lot of my peers, over the years have you know, succumbed to HIV or a couple, any of the other you know sexually transmitted diseases, but HIV thinned out my generation of gay and lesbian and I think that was one of the other things that will be helpful or has helped the kids that are coming out now is that, you know the one thing AIDS did was make being gay and front and center thing and it wasn’t perceived wonderfully because of that, it still isn’t perceived wonderfully because of that. In my lifetime I never expected to see legalized pot or gay marriage and I saw both of them in the same year, I mean I could guess I could die a happy man now.",rural;q-rural,
0:39:29,Denise,What advice could you give to a kids that was coming out today?,q-advice,
,Jerry Schutz,"It’s gonna get better. No matter what happens, it is going to get better. Don’t give up.",advice ;q-advice,
,Denise,"Very good. So let’s go back to, okay so you, I’m trying to get to the current employment. So, we went through military and then you came back to Moscow and you were working, well I don’t know, you tell me, like",q-work,
,Jerry Schutz,So what happened after I sold Link? ,;q-work,
,Denise,"Yes, that's where we were. ",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Oh lord, so after I sold link, I, well I sold Link, it was very shortly after Will disappeared and then I went on a four-month sabbatical to Costa Rica and just escaped. I came back, worked non-profits for a while. I was the Kenworthy executive producer, I was a downtown coordinator for a year, I worked for Appearances marketing for a couple years, had some great clients. I worked for Comcast, which was the advertising division of Adelphia at the time for the cable company and then I came back and I started working for Time Warner, those were like the major ones, but came back and started working for Time Warner and I don’t know, I just finished my six month probation to become a permanent employee and a few days later I got a job offer to go work for Norwegian Cruise lines and I went and worked on the cruise ship for two years and I worked in shore excursion, we generally took five to seven, usually responsible from anywhere from one and a half to two million dollars or revenue a week, some cruises, most cruises we were the bigger money maker over food and beverage. There were weeks where food and beverage did better than we were, but for the most part. I go to work in Hawaii for over a year, I was in Alaska for a summer, I did a fall cruise line, or a cruise run on, from New York to Canada, New England, Bay of Fundi, went down to Bermuda, hate Bermuda. Went on the western Caribbean, mom got sick at that point and she was told that she wasn’t gonna live more than two or three months. She had stage three emphysema, stage four emphysema, so I can home to help take care of her. Stayed, she was around for fifteen months, during that time I had a heart attack in September, so I came home in October, had the heart attack the following September. Meanwhile I had gone back to work at Time Warner, thankfully because they had wonderful insurance, they took me back there working. Had the heart attack, went and reassessed my life, realized that I could’ve died, probably should’ve died, got two stents, reassessed my life, looked at it and said, ‘what are, is the one thing I regret, you know what do I want to do.’ One thing I really regretted was that I hadn’t finished my nursing degree when I started back when I was at Arizona State, so I decided I couldn’t be a Time Warner employee for the rest of my life because I worked with somebody who was and I didn’t want to become that person, I’m sorry, but I started putting myself through school and went back to nursing school and then six years later, graduated with my RN and while I was in school, I pre accepted with Kootenai medical center in the behavioral health until. I was supposed to be doing something with adult home health because I was always being really involved, as an adult, trying to keep seniors in their homes as long as possible. Once they get into a skilled facility, they tend to decline pretty rapidly as part of that, but they didn’t have, the agency that they usually precept with had just hired new nurses and didn’t have anyone to precept with, so they sent me to Kootenai behavioral health. I worked in the unit for the hundred and forty hours. Right before I finished my hundred and forty hours, the director of behavioral health had come up to be and said ‘your resume will be on my desk by the end of the week’ because they other employees had been telling her they needed to hire me, and I graduated nursing school with a job. Went to work there, was there six weeks and had kidney cancer, I was diagnosed with kidney cancer from adireticulitous diagnosis and then I got the quarter of my kidney ripped out, recovered for six weeks, went back to work at Kootenai and then in December, actually in October dad is, started to show some signs of old age and a little bit of dementia, short term memory loss, not going to be able to drive and then I was looking through, you know what jobs am I going to be doing as a nurse and it turns out the resident assistant living across the street from me had an ad and had a sign on bonus, and I was like ‘well. How much are you paying.’ Well we can’t tell you that. We don’t know. Well what do you mean you don’t know. Well it comes from human resources. Fine, so I applied for the job and that whole thing was kind of unreal because I apply for the job, the next morning someone from Chicago is calling me and saying I want to interview you at two o’ clock in the afternoon, call me at this number, so I call in at this number and I talk to the guy and while I’m talking to him I’m not taking the damn thing seriously because I have a job, I know what I’m doing, I’m having a great time in Coeur d’Alene. So I clean the house, change my bed, got my laundry going and I don’t know, talked for maybe 45 minutes and the call ended, I was like well I’m never going to hear back from them, so I just packed everything up and you know, went back and started working back in Kootenai that next day and then the executive director at Clark called me and said ‘you know, I’d like to schedule an interview.’ Well I’m up here now until next week, so yeah maybe I can come see you next Tuesday, so we schedule an interview, I go in, we spend an hour and half talking again and again they’re not telling me anything and this one I’m actually paying a little bit more attention because well, I obviously got a second run and they’re going to make me go through this whole thing to tell me what they’re going to pay me and I’m gonna tell them no because you can’t afford me and we get done with the interview and right there he tells me that he wants to send me to Portland next week to meet with the divisional nurse and the regional nurse and I’m like fine and I get off my four days of twelve’s and get home the night before and at six o’clock in the morning, get on a plane and go to Portland for a four o’clock interview and I pretty much spend the whole day in transit because you can’t get anywhere from Moscow except Seattle and have to sit in Seattle forever, get the interview, she says they’ll call you in the morning and offer you the job and I’m like yeah, okay thanks. Fly back, get a call the next morning. They end up offering me five hundred dollars more a year than I was making at Kootenai, which was kind of nice because that’s like getting a twelve thousand dollar raise because I wasn’t having a thousand dollars in expenses in apartments and driving and my time and yeah, so, I started here December first and now I have a commute that’s probably a little longer than when I worked on the cruise ship, I mean the cruise ship was all the way on the other side and up seven flights of stairs. This one is just kinda up the street and over a little bit, so.",work,
0:48:00,Denise,"Awesome, so can you talk about Will? What happened to Will or how did you meet Will and what happened?",,
,Jerry Schutz,Yeah. I can talk about Will. Will and I met after the No On One Proposition.,,
,Denise,What was that? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"That was back in 1996, the anti-gay initiative in Idaho, they were trying to run a gay initiative and Proposition One and you wouldn’t be able to talk about being gay in public schools, it would’ve openly allowed all the discrimination that we’ve gotten rid of, it would’ve made sure that you’d never have a hate crime because it took out the hate crime provisions and there was, oh yeah and it codified the fact that you could evict, discriminate and jobs because somebody was gay. So yeah, it was a really nasty, mean spirited proposition. We spent all summer fighting it, at the end of the, after we had finally won in November, we had a dance down in Lewiston surprisingly. Surprise, surprise, another dance and while we were there, I drove a van down and took like ten people down from Moscow because I had vans, I owned Link Transportation, I was a bus company so, drove down the Lewiston and this kid comes up to me, three times and says, ‘you know, you’re really cute, will you call me.’ Yeah whatever and you know, like the fourth time, he takes a match book and goes ‘you know, my number’s in there, will you call me.’ And I’m like yes I will call you, just leave me alone and that’s how I met Will. We had two dates, both of them were miserable failures, the first one he showed up with a twelve pack of Bud Light, Bud Light, a pepperoni pizza and reservoir dogs for a movie, it was really not a wonderful thing. The next time we had, went out, I made salmon, he doesn’t like salmon, I made strawberry shortcake, he’s allergic to strawberries and I made asparagus and he doesn’t like asparagus. And then the next date I think we went out to a restaurant and in the middle of it I got a pager and had to get and drive to Spokane, so left him there and paid for the meal, but he ended up eating alone and so yeah, it really wasn’t supposed to work, but we made it work and we were together five years. We had just started remodeling the trailer, he went to a party at midnight because we had been working all day, I was ready to go to bed, so I was ‘yeah go party, have fun’ and um, he never came home.",politics; homophobia,
,Denise,"That’s so crazy, did they ever find him?",,
,Jerry Schutz,"Um, not as such. There was some skull and a jaw bone found maybe three or four years later out somewhere by Boville by some turkey hunters and they 95% identified it by dental record that it was his, but it’s still not",,
,Denise,Not confirmed? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,Not confirmed. ,,
,Denise,Were you close to his family? ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"Oh yeah, I was close to him mom and dad.",,
,Denise,"Yeah. That’s horrible. So, nobody knows what happened?",,
,Jerry Schutz,Nobody knows what happened.,,
,Denise,Nobody said anything at the party?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"It’s still an open, active case. It was a subject of MSNBS missing persons, it was a subject of Robert Stacks, whatever that is, unsolved mysteries and yeah, so we still never had any real closure. It’s still an active case at Moscow Police Department, every once in a while we’ll get a phone call and there will be something, some lead, some recent thing a few years ago, I got an email from somebody who wanted to talk about it because he was doing a documentary about it and I just didn’t feel like opening those scabs again and going through it with him, so I just kinda let that one slide by.",,
,Denise,Wow. That's crazy. ,,
,Jerry Schutz,"But you know, if you think about it, most people when they lose a partner, they have closure you know, I spent four years wondering if I was going to walk in the door and find him sleeping one the couch, every single day. It was a really hard place to be not knowing, you know, what happened to him and it’s still don’t know, but I have to move on and just that’s one of those things in my life.",,
,Denise,"You've had an amazing life, Jerry. ",,
,Jerry Schutz,I’ve had an interesting life.,,
,Denise,Definitely.,,
,Jerry Schutz,"I think there’s maybe a Chinese proverb, ‘may you live in interesting times.’",,
,Denise,I guess. ,,
,Jerry Schutz,I guess I have in interesting times,,
,Denise,"Can you talk about discrimination and go back to, you talked about the Prop One, which I didn’t know about, have you ever been discriminated against? That you’re aware of?",q-legislate; q-discrimination,
,Jerry Schutz,"Interesting. Probably. Probably more discriminated because I was a white male than I was a gay white male. Yeah, I, you asked about one of the factors that might have contributed, to you know, being a white male has its privileges, I mean really hard to say that, but if I was a man of color or Hispanic or a female I think my life might have turned out a little bit differently, but yeah, I got lucky and was born into the privileged class. Sorry.",;q-legislate; q-discrimination,
,Denise,Don’t be sorry. Have you or anyone you know been victims of a hate crime? Like did you think Will?,q-victim,
,Jerry Schutz,"Yes. I think there’s a possibility that Will was a victim of a hate crime. I don’t really subscribe to that because the idea of a hate crime is you want to find something, you want to terrorize, and so, I, that one has always kind of been an issue, you know on my, I can find people that will tell you ‘yes it was a hate crime.’ I can find people that will tell you ‘yeah I don’t know. Could’ve been a crime of passion.’ Have there been hate crimes, yes. Do I know people who have been beat up, been abused, been verbally assaulted, had their car spray-painted, had their windows broken, had house broken into, um yeah. I know all of those things, I’ve seen the ugly that happens and it’s sad you know, you really go to a gay pride event, I know I said I really don’t like those, but of the things about it, you go to Seattle’s gay pride, all a sudden you have fifty thousand people that have one thing in common, five minutes and but, you feel like a community, you walk down the street, you see people holding hands you know, you see, see a gay couple or a lesbian couple, people kissing on the street and you’re like ‘oh this a perfect world’ and then you come back the real world and it’s not a perfect world and I don’t think it ever will be a perfect world and that’s really the saddest part, you know alright so, we win liberalized thinking or you know, anti-discrimination for gays and lesbians, well we gotta have another scapegoat, so they will find the small minded people who, who hate, who have problems with people being different. They will find someone else to persecute. It has always been that way and it’s really a sad, sad commentary on human existence, that we are remembered by who we victimize.",homophobia;q-victim,
0:56:10,Denise,Talk about being a republican in Idaho?,,
,Jerry Schutz,"There’s not much to say. They are the party of choice. You know, seventy percent of this silly state, one million people, 1.5 million I think is what the state has, seventy thousand, eighty thousand people who voted, well no, there was really only I think thirty percent of them who voted, so take thirty percent out of one million, 1.5 million and I’m not gonna do the head math, well I probably could, so that’s maybe fifty thousand people, yeah five times three is fifteen, 1.5, so let’s say about fifty thousand people went to the pulls and voted, seventy percent of that fifty thousand voted for Donald Trump, that’s really disheartening. We have the reddest legislator in the country, at one point we had two democrats in the legislator, you put and ‘R’ behind your name and you run, that’s how we got out current senator and if you’re looking at this from twenty years ago, his name was Dan Foreman and he was a piece of shit, probably the worst thing I have said on the entire, entire tape, I used shit, he is mean, he is narrow minded, and how he got elected, I will never understand other than in Donald Trump’s coat tails because he had an ‘R’ behind his name. His first piece of legislation was to prosecute women and the doctors that perform abortions of first-degree murder. He voted against funding the university of Idaho, this year, the budget, he voted against it, out of all of the senators, it was whatever to one and he was the one. He comes from a university district, you don’t vote against the university, so yeah, I have no use for him. Yeah, the Republican Party politics, the religious right and the weirdos have taken over the party. It is not the party I grew up with, the democrats are not the party I want to be, I think we need somewhere else to go and I don’t think it’s the Greens and I really don’t think it’s the Libertarians, I did give my vote to the Libertarians this time because well, I just couldn’t vote for either one of the major parties and I’d rather give my vote to the third party and maybe get closer to having a third viable party in this country or a fourth or a fifth.",politcs,
,Denise,What do you think of the lack of legislation for the LGBTQ community in Idaho?,q-legislate,
,Jerry Schutz,"We don’t want to run. I mean you know, if you run, be a republican, be a democrat, I don’t care, but you know when I ran for city council, one of my opponents tried to turn it into or one of the newspaper tried to turn it into a campaign issue and I took the same tactic I’ve taken my entire life, I mean, five minutes, you cannot judge my qualifications on something that takes five minutes, once every three weeks, stop. You know, yeah, I’m gay, but I’m a lot of other things too, so you know, gay person runs, you know at this point it’s not gonna be an issue. It’s just, why would you want to run because it’s not fun and you know, unless you really have a passion about it, yeah, it’s not worth it. Yeah, you know I came to realize that when I was in the planning and zoning commission, I had more power than the city council members. Just from the stand point that I actually wrote policy or helped write policy and laws and rules, they don’t call them rules, they call them ordinances, anyway these rules, I helped write those for the betterment of the city and I didn’t have to vote on it, I just you know, sent it up to city council and then they approve it. The work took place down there, it didn’t take place at the city council and city council, in a lot of ways you’re constrained on what you can say because once the subject is, well the way it used to be was once a subject had a decision, you know you didn’t descend against the decision, you wrote and descending opinion and then you moved on. You didn’t keep beating a dead horse or tweeting about and you know, so one of the things that’s going to come out of this, this diabolical that is Donald Trump, is were gonna have some kind of redefinition of what is, what it is to be a politician, what it is to be a leader, what it is to be an elected official and we’re either gonna have a really interesting dynamic when this finishes shaking out. You know, we may end up with a different kind of relationship with our elected officials.",politcs;q-legislate,
