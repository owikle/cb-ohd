,Anonymous ,University of Alberta. ,,
,Denise ,Okay. And what did you study? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um. Um. For my bachelors, my first degree was in was medical biochemistry. Uh and then I went into plant biochemistry for my doctorate. ",,
,Denise ,Interesting. Okay. And then where did that lead you? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um, well from there I went to University of Davis. I worked there for five years in um, well two years in plant biochemistry, lipid metabolism and then two and a half years in virus diseases, virus biotechnology of plants. ",q-work ,
,Denise ,Wow. ,;q-work ,
,Anonymous ,"From there I taught at Simon Fraiser University for four years in Biology and then I worked in the federal government in Canada for ten years running virus disease control programs and supporting bio technology. And then for the last twenty years I worked at Washington State University in Prosser, um operating the national quarantine program for fruit trees and grapes. ",q-work ,
,Denise ,Fascinating. And then you retired? ,;q-work ,
,Anonymous ,I retired kind of. About two years ago. ,,
,Denise ,"Yeah. Okay. We're gonna go way back, so uh, when did you move to Idaho? ",,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, I started moving here, it was a long transition. I started moving here five years ago, but I've actually been here full time for three years. ",,
,Denise ,"Okay, so...",,
,Anonymous ,"Um, as I mentioned earlier I used to come down here in the 50's for summer vacation when I was a little kid to Coeur D'Alene, so I have fond memories of that. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. So was it your decision then to retire in Coeur D'Alene? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um, it was. Um, um I have a partner who lives in Idaho. Um, north of here and we decided collectively that this was a nice jumping off place, uh transition place for me. Um, I think it's become more of a permanent residence now, so...",,
,Denise ,"Yeah, awesome. Um, so I guess you grew up in Alberta. Would you describe it as urban or rural? ",q-up ,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, rural. ",;q-up ,
,Denise ,Rural. ,,
,Anonymous ,Yeah. ,,
,Denise ,"Okay. Um, were you out? When did you come out? What was coming out like? Was there a fear associated with it? ",q-out ,
,Anonymous ,"Um, I had no support when I was growing up. I knew I was different. ",;q-out ,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, I didn't even know what it was to be gay, to be honest. I mean in our house, I mean we had, it was of, a loving house in the sense I had all the physical amenities, but it was a very stade environment and you do not talk about personal feelings at all. And, so I really had no support whatsoever, support group. And I didn't really figure out um, what was going on. I knew it was different, but I didn't know what that meant until my 20's. And you know, I knew I was different. I tried to make it work as a homo...homosexual in a heterosexual world for a long way. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,Long time. Because that was my only point of reference. I mean that's the way you live. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And I did that for a long, long time. An embarrassingly long time. Um, actually it was probably in the early 2000's. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"That I finally decided that this is isn't fair to me. It's not fair to anybody. And so um, I stopped trying to fit into the heterosexual world at that point and consequently it became very isolated. Um, because I was, at that time a very homophobic environment. ",comingout; homophobia,
,Denise ,Where? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um, this was in rural Eastern Washington. And a long time ago someone made a comment about being gay. It's almost like being a spy because people don't always know you're gay and you hear their comments and things, just. ",homophobia,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,Very hurtful comments. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And uh, so rural Eastern Washington there was an event that happened just after I moved there. Um, and really uh, actually a gay fellow was murdered and it was just kind of, his life was discounted, 'well, he was just gay.' You know and so I just, I was totally isolated, uh threw myself at my work, which helped professionally, but personally it was pretty much a disaster. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
0:05:20,Anonymous ,"And so I stayed in the closet. I decided that um, for a long, long time um, I had just been coming out when I lived in Canada, but then I moved down here and there was these events in rural, uh Washington and I went so far back in the closet. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And so I just threw myself at my work. I was totally isolated at that point and uh, for a long until oh about about ten years ago. I just decided this is ridiculous. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,This is no way to live. ,,
,Denise ,Do you remember the moment that you decided that? And what prompted it? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um, it was...largely, well two things. First of all, I had been in kind of a on again, off again relationship with a woman, mostly off again for like twenty years. And I decided it wasn't fair to her. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"This, this wasn't gonna go anywhere. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And it wasn't fair to me either. And the second thing was um, a colleague of mine that was gay passed away and I thought it's just, it would be really horrible I think for someone to die and for the world not to know who I was. I mean I wasn't out, but it still, being gay still enforced such a large part of my life. And I just thought that, that was not, not a good legacy to leave behind. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,And so um... ,,
,Denise ,Who did you come out to first? ,q-out,
,Anonymous ,"Well, um, actually I met my partner online. So that was my first step and it started to get serious and during that process it became, it became more and more evident that I had to do something about this, um, the rest of my personal life because again he's a big part of my life and again if something happened to me no one would know who he was. ",comingout;q-out,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And so actually um, I was very selective. Um, I had a friend or have a friend I should say that we've been best friends since grade three up in Edmonton. Um, and he and his sister have just been big brother and sister to me. So, they were the first two that I came out to. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. And were they supportive? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,And that's why I chose them. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Because, well because I know them and um, they've both been involved in social work and things like that in, in Alberta. So, I felt very comfortable, no I didn't feel comfortable. I was scared. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,Because I mean once you come out you can't take it back. ,,
,Denise ,"No, I know right. And that's, I'm kind of interested in, there's this continual coming out. Like straight people don't do that. They don't introduce themselves and have to come out as straight, you know. ",comingout,
,Anonymous ,That's absolutely true. It's not a single event. I mean it's a process. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"So, I came out to them. It was my first big step and they were very, very supportive. Um, then I came out, a period of months later I came out to my brother. And that was, for a while then the rest of it was kind of on hiatus. They were the important people in my life. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. Were your parents around still? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Oh, oh they passed many, many years ago. ",,
,Denise ,"Yeah, okay. ",,
,Anonymous ,"And I have very few living relatives. Um, as a matter of fact that was one of the things that was upsetting to me earlier on is that um, when I lived in California my cousin was living in Berkeley in the early 80's and he unfortunately died from AIDS and his mother, my aunt, was just so ashamed of him that he, I mean embarrassed and ashamed she had a son that died of AIDS and again it just really cemented that my perception of what the world thought. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, of gay people. Um, so anyway um I can't remember where I was in my....",,
,Denise ,"Oh well that's okay, but...",,
,Anonymous ,I'm sorry. ,,
,Denise ,"No, it's okay. ",,
0:09:58,Anonymous ,"So, I eventually also in my professional career, a lot of the people I worked with were ultra conservative people. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,And so professionally I stayed in the closet. ,,
,Denise ,Until you retired? ,,
,Anonymous ,And...until I retired. ,,
,Denise ,Wow. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And I mean that caused an awful lot of conflict for me because on the one hand as being a professional and being gay, you know I think it's important to be visible, so that people know that there are gays that can be professionals and pursue all these different lots of life. ",work ,
,Denise ,Yeah and have a Phd and do a lot of cool science. Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Exactly. Exactly. But, I also knew I risked losing a lot of the clients I worked with and so I wrestled with that for a long, long time. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"I finally, when I made the decision to retire, I did come out to one staff member who um, we had kinda developed a friendship and um, I think she was, I assumed that she was fairly liberal. ",work,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And, and we worked closely together. I came out to her and she was very supportive, again. But I really didn't come out until I retired and my partner came to my retirement party. ",,
,Denise ,That's cool. ,,
,Anonymous ,"A lot of my friends from Idaho that I had made over, as I said it was kind of a transition when I retired and so I was kind of moving up here and so a lot of my friends from Idaho came down to the retirement party as well. ",,
,Denise ,That's very cool. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Yeah, so yeah. It was. It was very cool. ",,
,Denise ,"That's cool. So, can we go back then. So, like do you recall any models or messages that you had about LGBTQ people when you were growing up? ",q-models,
,Anonymous ,"Absolutely none. Um, actually really I didn't know. It's embarrassing to admit this, but I was in such an isolated environment when I was growing up I didn't even know two men could have a relationship. I mean that's, that was the bottom line. ",;q-models,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"I mean I knew I was different, but I didn't know what that meant. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,You know. ,,
,Denise ,"Well and it's difficult.. it's like puberty and all of that is hard enough, you know. ",,
,Anonymous ,Exactly. ,,
,Denise ,"Yeah. And not to have any sort of kind of resource or yeah. Um, so obviously then there were no like clubs or organizations or anything. When did you start getting involved LGBTQ community? ",,
,Anonymous ,"Basically that was just recently when I moved to Idaho. Um, because as I said that's when I really came out. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And uh, um, I've been gradually getting indoctrinated into...",,
,Denise ,Sure. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Into the culture here. Just this year I've, I've supported the Pride Foundation. I went to some of their events and starting to realize the need that was, what a tremendous need there was. Um, when I moved up here, to be honest I downsized when I moved up to Coeur D' Alene and so must of my furniture and everything I donated to gay support church in the Tri Cities. ",clubs,
,Denise ,Cool. ,,
,Anonymous ,"In Washington. You know, anything I could do to help. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And that was the first inkling I had of how much these people really, these are the people that are on the fringe, okay. And how much they really depend on having some sort of, some form of support ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Because a lot of them, they don't have families. Their families have disowned them. They're basically out on their own trying to figure out life and it's tough. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And so when I moved to Coeur D'Alene, uh my partner, so I went to several Pride Foundation organi...uh, meetings, events and started to meet people there. And my uh, partner went to a church group, a Unitarian Church group in Spokane that had a senior group for elders. And so I went to a couple of their meetings and it was really, it's uplifting and sad. Uh, so many of the people there just were so appreciative to have a place to go where there aren't any labels and they could just go there and be safe and secure. ",clubs,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And so I volunteered for a pride event here in Coeur D'Alene. Um, again for the seniors and just hearing their stories um, was you know the fear of coming out in assisted living facilities. ",,
,Denise ,Wow. Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um, again it's this idea, once you come out you can't take it back. And the fear is that they're gonna get substandard care. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
0:15:05,Anonymous ,"Um, one woman was terrified that, she was still working and she was terrified that someone would see her talking to the gays, you know and this is, this is not right. ",homophobia,
,Denise ,No. ,,
,Anonymous ,And so I've really the last...,,
,Denise ,And that's recently. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Oh, that was this summer. ",,
,Denise ,"This is just like, 2000, teens. Wow. ",,
,Anonymous ,2018,,
,Denise ,Wow.,,
,Anonymous ,"And uh, so I've really kind of doubled down and yes, we need some sort of support here. Um, my first priority is just to have a safe place for these people to go and just feel comfortable. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, that's the top priority. And then as a group, I'm working with the North Idaho Pride Alliance now to try and just get education and um, resources out to these people. Um, these people, I mean they're very, I mean it's amazing how many people, particularly the elders. I mean elders and the general population tend to be isolated, but then you layer the LGBT issues on top of that and it's just really quiet startling. ",clubs,
,Denise ,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, and so the people that belong to Pride Alliance, I mean it's very diverse then, right? ",,
,Anonymous ,"Um, that's right. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And um, uh, yes. Very diverse. And um, I, I feel that too. I mean there's transgender, um I mean there's a long alphabet of descriptions now days. But it's great. I mean you just go there and nobody cares. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,I mean you just go there and there's people you can talk to and socialize with and feel safe. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,Now with the Pride Alliance in the process of setting up a seperate group within that...,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,Specifically for elders. As a matter of fact we're having our first social today. ,,
,Denise ,What are you doing? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, we're having a coffee down here in the senior center at Jewett House. ",,
,Denise ,Awesome. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And just uh, I'm amazed at the amount of interest we've had in the seniors group. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. That's fantastic. ,,
,Anonymous ,For LGBTQ seniors. ,,
,Denise ,"So, that's interesting because nobody I've talked to yet has talked about this issue. ",,
,Anonymous ,No. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. Talk about it. ,,
,Anonymous ,"They talk about you know, the teens and...",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Youth and that sort of thing, which is...I'm not belittling that problem at all, but the LGBTQ senior population is really in need. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,And a lot of us grew up in an age with sometimes violent discrimination. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,And we're carrying all that baggage around with us and so I think that's what's causing a lot of the fear as I said particularly in the seniors. So...,,
,Denise ,"Yeah and well in a conservative state too, it's...",,
,Anonymous ,And a conservative state. Yes. ,,
,Denise ,"Um, would you say most of the people in that group came out later in life like you?",q-out ,
,Anonymous ,"Um, I think not as late as I did. ",;q-out ,
,Denise ,"Not as late as you, okay. Okay. Fair enough. Well what advice would you give to a young person today in Idaho who is thinking about coming out? ",q-advice ,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, well first of all seek out safe place. Uh, that's key to have a refuge where you can go and be with your peers, whatever that is. However you want to define that. Um, and so you can be comfortable in your own skin. Uh, I think that's key. Um, of course in Idaho there still is a lot of discrimination and you have to be careful. ",advice ;q-advice ,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Unfortunately. Um, so you know every...it's hard to give advice because everybody's different. ",,
,Denise ,"I know. Everybody has a, I've heard so many different coming out stories. It's amazing. Yeah. ",,
,Anonymous ,"Exactly. And so, it's definitely isn't one size fits all to any stretch of the imagination. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,Uh and I don't think I'm a particularly good example. ,,
,Denise ,"Well, did you feel a sense of relief when you finally came out? ",,
,Anonymous ,"I did. Well, absolutely. Uh, the last five years...well and you mentioned earlier the coming out process. I mean first of all there's coming out to yourself. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"The trying to fit in this heterosexual mold is not, is not the way to go. And, and for me that was a very traumatic experience. Just finally letting go of that myth. ",comingout,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, it was a myth for me anyway. And uh, you know then there's coming out to people. Um, so yeah. It's, it's definitely a process. ",,
,Denise ,"Yeah. Um, did you ever...well, I guess my question is um, what would you say as a youth and then as adult were dangerous places or spaces or people and then the opposite. What would be safe safe places or spaces or people that you've encountered? ",q-danger ,
0:20:24,Anonymous ,"Uh, well dangerous places um, you know if you're out on the street not everyone, I mean not everyone knows you're gay. Some people...I think that's the different story for cross dresser, transgender people. I think they are so much more at risk. Um, again just because of....",homophobia;q-danger ,
,Denise ,Visual. Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Visual cues. Yeah. And I really emphasize with them because that, that must be terrible to be in that situation. You know, it's the same with people of color. I mean you can't hide...",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,That. ,,
,Denise ,No. Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, but uh, so I think uh, so for me anyway just being out, out in public...",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Poor choice of words. Was not that much of a problem. I mean my partner and I, there's still no public displays of affection. ",,
,Denise ,Does that hurt you? Does that bother you? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, it doesn't bother me. I mean I would like to be in a place where you know, we could hold hands or you know, hug each other in public. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"You know, we do that to a certain extent, you know at airports and things like that where it's...",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Not that out of line you know, for two men to...",,
,Denise ,Sure. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Be doing, having physical contact, but it would be nice where you could just relax and like I said, be yourself. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah and I mean does it still feel...you do that because it's the sense of self preservation. ,,
,Anonymous ,Yes. ,,
,Denise ,"Yeah. Interesting. Um, have you ever known anyone or have you ever experienced discrimination? Slurs, uh, physical violence, hate crimes, anything of that nature? ",q-discrimination ,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, definitely no uh, I haven't had any physical violence against me. Um, and um, the slurs as I said is mostly, were encounters I had before I came out. And as I said it's this condition where you hear what people say and there's been some pretty horrible remarks made in my presence about gays. And again that was another source of conflict of what do I do. ",;q-discrimination ,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Do I uh, kind of come out to defend that? ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And I supervise a large staff. Well, in my opinion a large staff is like twenty-six people. ",,
,Denise ,That's a large staff. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And you know, I used to hear discriminatory remarks and I always made the point of making a kind of generic statement that we don't tolerate any kind of discrimination in the workplace. Um, I didn't respond specifically to gay targeted issues. ",homophobia,
,Denise ,"Yeah, but you addressed it. That's good. ",,
,Anonymous ,Yes. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. Wow. ,,
,Anonymous ,And so I think that's the thing. Is an adult you face all these conflicts. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"I mean even as an adult how to, you know how, how do I navigate this world. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"In some respects you do hear a lot about gay youth and I know there's a high suicide rate in the gay youth population and it's, I mean I, it's hard to um, understand, well I understand the despair. I can't see, it's hard for me to understand getting to the point where someone would take their life. ",homophobia,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um, but um, I don't know. I guess everyone just has to figure it out for themselves, unfortunately. The best thing to do is just talk to your peers, your mentors, whoever you feel safe with. ",,
,Denise ,When was the first time you ever met another person like you? Do you know? ,,
,Anonymous ,"Um, I do. Uh, I went down to, when I was living in California my cousin was living in the bay area and um, I went down to visit him of course. And he was in a gay relationship in the bay area and as I said that was the first time I knowingly met a gay person. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. And how old were you? ,,
0:25:27,Anonymous ,"Probably about twenty-eight, twenty-nine. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. That's a long time. Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Yeah. That's when I first, sort of the light bulb went on. Oh, two men can have a relationship. ",,
,Denise ,Right. ,,
,Anonymous ,You know. ,,
,Denise ,"Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, so what like, today what strategies or resources help you live your life as an out, gay man? And how is it different than when you were younger or in your teens or in your twenties? ",q-resources,
,Anonymous ,"Well as I said, when I was a teen in my twenties I mean there were no resources even though that I was gay. ",;q-resources,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"I knew I was different, so that's kind of not relevant to this conversation. The thing that right now that's important to me is just having, well first of all my friends are supporting me. And also these social groups. Um, again they're not pick-up groups or things like that. They're just people to go, where you can have people to go and have coffee and talk to people and you don't worry about the fact that you're gay, lesbian, transgender, whatever. It's just, someone made the comment to me, it's just people without labels. ",clubs,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,And I think that's so wonderful to have that. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Uh, so that's right, for me right now that's the most important thing is just having that social space, so. Um, as time progresses um, you know presumably at some point I'll be facing the assisted living question. ",clubs,
,Denise ,Right. ,,
,Anonymous ,"And so on, so I'll be addressing those in the future. ",,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,But at the...,,
,Denise ,Is it something you worry about? Do you think about it? ,,
,Anonymous ,I do. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. Yeah. Okay.  ,,
,Anonymous ,I don't have any solutions...,,
,Denise ,No. ,,
,Anonymous ,But I do worry about it. ,,
,Denise ,"I'm kinda interested in how in, in your life span how has the perception of LGBTQ people changed over time? Or do you think it has changed? ",,
,Anonymous ,I think...,,
,Denise ,"Because we're still hearing things that we don't want to hear, right? ",,
,Anonymous ,"I think it has changed. Um, you're right. We're still hearing things that we don't want to hear and unfortunately I think we're going through a period of tribalism right now that, where it is becoming okay to say things that we don't want to hear. ",homophobia,
,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,More okay. ,,
,Denise ,Yeah. Yeah. Thanks to our Emperor Cheeto. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Yes. Um, and I, I, that's very disappointing to me. ",,

,Denise ,Yeah. ,,
,Anonymous ,"Which is understandable. And he was really hurt, hurting from that. And um, he was just starting to kind of come out of the pits when I met him. And um, so we've gone through this process with family. I guess his kids felt that there was still a chance that this was you know, just a phase. And the family would come back together. And when I arrived on the scene it sort of became real to them. ",family,
